<p>I am a problem solver. When I get up in the morning I’m excited about the projects I’m working on and look at each day as a fantastic opportunity to surpass exciting challenges. In the past, I got involved in two blockchain-centric open-source projects. The first is Rebooting The Web of Trust, where we are working on developing standards for decentralised identity. The second is Blockcerts, which is a platform that allows for the creation of certificates of accomplishment (e.g. University diplomas), which are issued on the Bitcoin blockchain. I contributed to Blockcerts, by working with members of their team, in designing a new architecture for the system, focused using the Ethereum blockchain, instead of Bitcoin.
The second, on my M.Sc thesis, I designed and implemented a prototype, of a censorship-resistant system for Web Annotations, called DClaims. The system was built using Ethereum smart-contracts and IPFS.
I joined Consensys in the summer of 2018. It gave the oportunity to grow as a software engineer. I integrated two different spokes, always working on Ethereum related tasks. My current goal is to continue working on the Ethereum ecossystem.
